Disease Detector – Bootcamp Project
📌 Overview
Disease Detector is a machine learning project developed during a 5-day AI bootcamp. It predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on structured patient health data. The model uses classification algorithms to analyze clinical features and generate interpretable predictions that support early diagnosis and decision-making.
Built in Python using Google Colab, this project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model deployment.

🚀 Key Features
- 🔍 Clean and preprocess health datasets
- 🧪 Train ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- 📊 Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 📁 Export trained models for reuse
- 📂 Upload user data for real-time prediction
- 📈 Visualize feature importance and decision boundaries

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas → Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn → ML algorithms
- Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization
- Joblib → Model saving/loading
- Google Colab → Notebook interfac

📊 Workflow Summary
- Load heart_dataset.csv
- Encode categorical features
- Scale numerical features
- Train model using RandomForestClassifier
- Evaluate with accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
- Save model using joblib.dump()
- Predict on new user data using uploaded CSV or manual input

🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🌐 Build a Streamlit or Flask web app for real-time prediction
- 🧬 Expand dataset to include multiple disease categories
- 🧠 Integrate deep learning models for improved accuracy
- ☁️ Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Heroku)
- 🔐 Add basic security layer for user data handling
